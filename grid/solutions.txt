1. 	To use Bootstrap, link the Bootstrap stylesheet <link> into your <head> before all other 
	stylesheets to load the CSS. Then you add the JavaScript plugins, jQuery, and Tether near the 
	end of your pages, right before the closing </body> tag. 

2.	The Bootstrap grid is a library of HTML/CSS components that allow you to structure a website 
	and its content in desired locations easily. Like a sheet of graph paper, the Bootstrap grid
	is made up of 12 columns and n rows so that you can easily place content where you want. The
	container class holds the grid elements. Withing the container class you can define row and
	columns with specific class attributes that allow for customization.
